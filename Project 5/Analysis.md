## What is Causing Returns?

- Built worksheets analyzing different views on return rates.
- Created two different types of composite charts showing return rates for a mix of multiple factors.

## Building a Dashboard for Monitoring Returns

- Created low-fidelity mock-ups of the dashboard, including three variations of pen and paper sketches.
- Developed a template for the dashboard using empty containers and added worksheets to the dashboard template.

## Presenting the Analysis and Dashboard

- Developed a story arc for the presentation, including an analysis of returns and how returns should be measured.
- Identified root causes of returns.
- Provided an overview of the dashboard components and a demo of how the dashboard should be used.

## Findings and Conclusion

The analysis indicates that the return problem in the Superstore is caused by multiple factors. Some of these factors are internal and can be addressed once we identify the products with high return rates. We can evaluate these products in terms of profits and sales and decide if we want to fix the issue, especially if the product has potential gains for the Superstore. 

Key comparisons include:
- Return Rates vs. Average Profits
- Return Costs vs. Total Sales

If the profit associated with a product is negative, it may be prudent to consider removing it from our catalog. Seasonal effects have also been considered in the dashboard. For products identified for further analysis due to their potential, we recommend a course of action to address issues related to quality, shipping, and other probable causes of returns. Finally, we will decide if it is worthwhile to keep them in our inventory.
