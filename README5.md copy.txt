## What is causing returns?

Build worksheets analyzing different views on return rates

Create two different kinds of composite charts showing return rate for a mix of multiple factors.

## Building a Dashboard for monitoring returns

Low fidelity mock-up of the dashboard, 3 variations of pen and paper sketches. Template for the dashboard using empty containers, add worksheets to the dashboard template.

## Presenting the analysis and dashboard

Created a story arc for the presentation including an analysis of returns, how should returns be measured. Root causes of returns, overview of the components of the dashboard and a demo of how the dashboard should be used.

## Findings and Conclusion

The conclusions of our analysis indicate that the return problem in the superstore is caused by multiple factors. Some of these factors are internal and can be addressed once we identify the products with high return rates. We can evaluate these products in terms of profits and sales and decide if we want to fix the issue if the product has potential gains for the superstore. We compare Return Rates Vs Average of Profits and Return Costs vs Total Sales. If the profit associated with a product is negative, we can consider removing it from our catalog. It is also important to consider the seasonal effect, which has been accounted for in the dashboard as well. For the products identified for further analysis due to their potential, we recommend a course of action to address issues related to quality, shipping, and other probable causes of these returns. Finally, we will decide if it is worthwhile to keep them in our inventory.
