# Zomato Onboarding Assignment: Customer Analysis
**Problem Description:**
You've been hired as a junior analyst for Zomato. Zomato is a multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. As your first assignment in the onboarding process, you’re given several test datasets to analyze the business performance of restaurants and customers registered in the service.
**BI-Analytics Team in Zomato usually performs 3 types of analysis:**
1. **Customer Analysis Segmentation:** 
   - Who are Zomato’s customers?
   - What segments can we split them into?
   - What is their purchasing behavior?
2. **Restaurant Analysis:** 
   - What restaurants are popular?
   - What restaurants generate the highest revenue?
   - Why?
3. **Sales Analysis:** 
   - Dynamics of sales/revenue over time
   - Main KPIs
   - Change in distribution of sales and more
Your Team Lead expects you to perform one type of the analysis as well. Choose 1 out of the 3 areas to focus on and build your research plan. At the end of your onboarding process, you should present the dashboard related to the area as well as the main key points of your analysis in the format of a report or presentation.
**Data:**
Download the archive with the test data given by your Team Lead. You’ll find 5 tables there:
- `food`
- `menu`
- `orders`
- `restaurant`
- `users`
It should be more than enough for you to complete your onboarding assignment; there is no need to use additional information. You may use one or several tables from the database, depending on your goal. You may join the data as you wish.

## Research Plan
### Objective
To conduct a Customer Analysis with Segmentation to understand Zomato’s customer base. The analysis will categorize customers by occupation, education, monthly income, gender, and marital status, and will explore their purchasing behaviors. The findings will be presented through various visualizations on a Power BI dashboard.
### Key Questions
- **KPIs**: Count of Unique Customers, Orders per customer, and Rate of returning customers.
- **Customer Distribution by Education and Gender**: Donut Chart, Pie Chart, or Stacked Bar Chart
- **Customer Distribution by Cuisine**: Bar Chart or Tree Map
- **Customer Distribution by Income and Occupation**: Clustered Bar Chart or Heat Map
- **Customer Distribution by Age and Family Size**: Displayed in a Table combined with an Area Chart.
- **Customers by Location**: Map
### Hypotheses to be Tested
- Middle-aged adults represent the highest number of customers, with an average of sales.
- Adults with higher education will reflect higher Customer Lifetime Value and a higher purchase rate.
- Customers with higher income levels will reflect higher sales.
- Larger family sizes will correlate with higher sales volumes.
### Data Preparation and Cleaning
Before answering the questions on the dashboard, the data will be cleaned and validated to ensure accuracy. This step includes:
- Checking for and handling missing values.
- Correcting inconsistencies in the data.
- Ensuring the data is formatted correctly for analysis.
- Additional columns or measures may be created as necessary to accurately answer the questions and test the hypotheses.
The scope of the analysis and any required corrections will be determined in consultation with the team leader.
### Dashboard Filtering
The dashboard will include filters for Location, Cuisine, and Years, enabling users to customize their view and drill down into specific data segments.
This plan offers a well-defined framework for analyzing customer segmentation and behavior, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all pertinent aspects. As the project evolves, it allows for the integration of adjustments and additional details to address specific needs and emerging insights with my team leader.
