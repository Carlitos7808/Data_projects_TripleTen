## Project Overview

Analysis of Superstore by:
- **Part 1:** Profit & Losses
- **Part 2:** Advertising
- **Part 3:** Returned Items

In the analysis of Superstore, I established a left join relationship between Orders and Returns. Each sheet has been carefully named, and I created three dashboards to present my findings. To maintain clarity, I labeled the sheets corresponding to their respective dashboard numbers, such as ‘1.1, 1.2, 1.3’ for Dashboard 1.

## Findings and Conclusion

After analyzing data from all years, I filtered results to examine each year individually. Overall, I observed minimal changes in profits or returns, with some instances even showing increased returns compared to the average profit benchmark. Consequently, my final conclusion remains unchanged: the Superstore, in its current state, is not financially viable.

Notably, significant discounts were observed, possibly contributing to this issue. I recommend engaging with high-return-rate customers to enhance their experience and identifying potential causes for returns. Additionally, it’s prudent to monitor profit fluctuations over time should we opt to continue operating the Superstore. Given the consistently low average profits and high return rates, prompt action is imperative to effect necessary changes or consider permanent closure.
