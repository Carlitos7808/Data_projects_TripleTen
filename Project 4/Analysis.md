## Project Overview

In the analysis of the Superstore dataset, I’ve established a left join relationship between Orders and Returns. Each sheet has been carefully named, and I’ve created three dashboards to present my findings. To maintain clarity, I’ve labeled the sheets corresponding to their respective dashboard numbers, such as ‘1.1, 1.2, 1.3’ for Dashboard 1.

The analysis is divided into three parts:
1. **Part 1: Profit & Losses**
2. **Part 2: Advertising**
3. **Part 3: Returned Items**

## Findings and Conclusion

After analyzing data from all years, I filtered the results to examine each year individually. Overall, I observed minimal changes in profits or returns, with some instances even showing increased returns compared to the average profit benchmark. Consequently, my final conclusion remains unchanged: the superstore, in its current state, is not financially viable. Notably, significant discounts were observed, possibly contributing to this issue. 

### Recommendations
- Engage with high-return-rate customers to enhance their experience and identify potential causes for returns.
- Monitor profit fluctuations over time to assess the financial viability of continuing the Superstore operations.
- Given the consistently low average profits and high return rates, prompt action is imperative to effect necessary changes or consider the permanent closure of the store.
